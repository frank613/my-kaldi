## Optional text corpus normalization and LM training
## These scripts are here primarily as a documentation of the process that has been
## used to build the LM. Most users of this recipe will NOT need/want to run
## this step. The pre-built language models and the pronunciation lexicon, as
## well as some intermediate data(e.g. the normalized text used for LM training),
## are available for download at http://www.openslr.org/11/
